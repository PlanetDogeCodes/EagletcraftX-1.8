Eagletcraft is a packaged and optimized Eaglercraft launcher that runs well on low end devices, such as chromebooks. This repository contains what you need to run Eagletcraft on your own along with the source (xml) file.

Note: As of 4-5-2025, EagletcraftX will no longer recieve weekly patches (This is due to the dicontinuation of service for the base game, EaglercraftX 1.8). Occasional monthly source patches will continue when needed.

**HOW IT WORKS:**
Eagletcraft was made by distibuting the code of EaglercraftX into many seperate hosted files, then using an html page as a relay for all the seperate files to communicate with one another. This inherently creates latency, so all static files are preloaded onto your PC's flash memory to combat this. 

**WHY IT WORKS:**
The reason Eagletcraft runs so well on low-end devices is because none of your computer's RAM is being wasted trying to update static files every time you give the game an input.
